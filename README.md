# 📱 KiraExperience-14

**KiraExperience-14** is a continuation of the **PixelExperience** project — rebuilt and reimagined for legacy and community-requested Android devices.  
We’re keeping devices like **mido** and **begonia** alive with the latest **Android 14** — even if they’ve been forgotten by official maintainers.

> Because no device should be left behind.  
> Whether it’s a once-popular midrange or an underdog still loved by users, **KiraExperience** brings Android 14 to those that deserve it.

## 📦 What is this?

This is **not** a fork of the original PixelExperience GitHub — it is a **community continuation**, focused on:

- Supporting **older devices** no longer officially maintained.
- Building stable AOSP-based ROMs with PE-like features.
- Offering helpful recovery zips and bugfixes for unsupported users.

## ✅ Target Devices

- **Redmi Note 8 Pro (begonia)**  
- 💬 *More community-requested devices will be added based on demand.*

## 🧪 Goals

- Maintain Android 14 support for legacy phones.
